## Introduction

This repository aims to provide comprehensive resources for learning and applying statistical techniques. It includes detailed explanations of various statistical concepts along with their mathematical formulas, Python code examples, and visualizations where applicable.

## Key Concepts

### Descriptive Statistics
- Measures the central tendency (mean, median, mode), dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and distribution shape (skewness, kurtosis) of data.
- Key Topics: Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, Skewness, Kurtosis.

### Probability Distributions
- Describes the likelihood of different outcomes in an experiment.
- Key Distributions: Normal Distribution, Binomial Distribution, Poisson Distribution.

### Hypothesis Testing
- Procedures for testing assumptions or claims about population parameters.
- Common Tests: Z-Test, T-Test, ANOVA, Chi-Squared Test.

### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
- A statistical method used to compare the means of three or more groups.
- Topics: One-Way ANOVA, Two-Way ANOVA.

### Chi-Squared Test
- A statistical test to determine if there is a significant association between categorical variables.
- Topics: Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit, Chi-Squared Test of Independence.
